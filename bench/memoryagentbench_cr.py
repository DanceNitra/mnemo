"""
MemoryAgentBench — Conflict Resolution (FactConsolidation) external benchmark, inspeximus vs accumulate baseline.

Why this bench: MemoryAgentBench (Hu et al., arXiv:2507.05257) reports that on the Conflict-Resolution axis
EVERY evaluated memory system (mem0, MemGPT, Cognee, BM25 RAG, full-context GPT-4o) scores single digits
(<=7%). CR = "update outdated information instead of accumulating", which is exactly inspeximus's supersession.
This is neutral, published, external ground, not a self-authored probe.

Task (FactConsolidation, multi-hop, ~6k context): a numbered stream of facts where the SAME (subject,
relation) is later RESTATED with a new value; a multi-hop question asks for the CURRENT (latest) value.
An accumulate store surfaces the stale value and the LLM chains the wrong fact.

Fairness: SAME LLM for both arms (Ollama Cloud), the ONLY difference is the memory layer:
  - baseline "accumulate": the LLM sees ALL fact lines (stale + updated).
  - inspeximus "consolidate": each parseable fact is remember()'d with key=(subject|relation); a later
    restatement supersedes the earlier, so the LLM sees only the LATEST value per key.
We report the baseline number too, so the <=7% claim is reproduced under our protocol, not assumed.
