"""Severe test for inspeximus 0.5.0 verify_attribution() — tamper-evidence for the ATTRIBUTION FLOOR.

The point (jacksonxly, r/RAG thread, the close): k, the influence budget, the influence gate and slash are all
keyed on a memory's canonical SOURCE id. So attribution is not a fourth defense axis — it is the FLOOR the other
three stand on, and it is the only one that isn't self-certifying: a single post-hoc RELABEL of a source id voids
all three at once, SILENTLY, with no inner layer to appeal to.

The fix (0.5.0): bind each write's attribution (own source + inherited derived_from taint) into the existing
tamper-evident receipt chain, so a relabel no longer matches the receipt and verify_attribution() flags it. A
relabel becomes LOUD, not silent.

This probe checks four claims (pure mechanism, no LLM):
  (1) a clean store verifies ok;
  (2) a post-hoc RELABEL (rewrite a record's source) is DETECTED;
  (3) a TAINT-STRIP (silently drop a derived summary's inherited taint to launder a poisoned origin) is DETECTED;
  (4) the HONEST LIMIT: a source that is WRONG at write time is committed faithfully and is NOT flagged — tamper-
      evidence is integrity of the record, not correctness of the claim (the oracle problem is untouched).
Plus: editing a past receipt breaks the hash chain (chain_ok False).
