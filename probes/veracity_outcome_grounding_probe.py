veracity_outcome_grounding_probe.py  --  the LAYER-2 path we kept saying didn't exist. MIT.

Two layers of the memory-poisoning problem (DeepSeek-V3 #1462, @icophy):
  Layer 1 (provenance): did the tool call HAPPEN?  -> closable by a runtime signature
                        (execution_receipt_gate_probe.py). Signing authenticates the SOURCE.
  Layer 2 (veracity):   is a genuinely-executed call's OUTPUT true?  -> a real call can return
                        attacker-influenced data (MINJA 2503.03704 / PoisonedRAG 2402.07867) that is
                        signed honestly and keeps full standing. This is the layer we kept "closing."

WHY it looked like a dead-end: we framed layer 2 as "decide truth AT WRITE TIME." That IS impossible --
a novel fact has no priors (measured ~100% poisonable), count-corroboration is Sybil-forgeable
(Cheng-Friedman 2005), and an attestation signs authorship not truth. But truth-standing does NOT have to
be a write-time decision.

THE PATH (this probe): standing is EARNED at USE time from an OBSERVED OUTCOME, not decided at write.
The gate does NOT detect poison; it DEFERS the truth question to a consequence the application observes,
converting an undecidable ("is Y true") into a checkable ("did acting on Y work"). A malicious payload
CANNOT earn a good outcome on its malicious use without ceasing to be malicious -- so it is caught
retroactively. This is exactly what an out-of-session consolidation pass (icophy's Dream Cycle) is
positioned to run: promote Episodic->Core only for memories that have been USED and produced good outcomes.

BLUNT SCOPE (so this is not mistaken for a detection result): the outcome-grounding path is textbook
(defeasible/provisional facts, Doyle 1979 truth-maintenance; reputation-from-outcomes, Dellarocas 2003 /
Resnick 2000; credit assignment, Sutton-Barto). Phase 2 below is an API DEMONSTRATION, not a detector:
the application SUPPLIES the good/bad outcomes; the probe just shows inspeximus defers standing to them. The one
label-INDEPENDENT, mechanism-level property here is the REVERSIBILITY CHECKPOINT in Phase 3a
(spend_irreversible) -- it bounds a benign-earned memory's irreversible tail whether or not you can tell
the memory is true. The honest takeaway is a design stance ("convert write-time-undecidable into
use-time-observable, and gate the irreversible tail"), NOT a solved veracity oracle.

Measured on the real inspeximus store (not a model of it). Run: python veracity_outcome_grounding_probe.py

HONEST, stated up front (this RAISES/BOUNDS, it does not CLOSE):
 - LOAD-BEARING ASSUMPTION: harm from acting on a poison is OBSERVABLE at use (a failed compile, a bounced
   transaction, a wrong answer that gets caught). Where harm is UNOBSERVABLE or DELAYED, the gate can't help
   (measured below) -- and an honest fact with no outcome yet is ALSO withheld (the false-withhold price).
 - RESIDUAL: a SLEEPER that behaves benignly to earn real good outcomes, then defects on a use whose harm
   isn't observed in time. Outcome-grounding can't catch it (measured); it is bounded, not closed, by a
   reversibility checkpoint (spend_irreversible) on the first IRREVERSIBLE use.
