"""trusted_only_poison_defense_probe.py — deterministic defense against FORGED-PROVENANCE memory poisoning.

Threat: an attacker who can WRITE memories and adapt — forges the warrant STRING an honest fact uses, AND mints its
own Ed25519 keypairs to attest the poison plus a Sybil corroborator (so it has distinct verified keys too). A poison
phrased to match the query out-ranks the truth on similarity, so plain recall (and even the warrant-tier that counts
distinct keys without a trust root) returns the poison.

Defense: recall(trusted_only=True) with a trust root (trust_seeds = allowlisted signing keys, set ONCE like a CA).
A hit is returned only if its origin is anchored to that root (attested by a seed key, seed-vouched source, or a
trusted link). The attacker can forge strings and mint keys but cannot sign as a TRUSTED key, so its poison is
excluded — deterministically, zero-LLM. Asserts (each able to FAIL):
  1. default recall returns the POISON (the attack works absent the defense — so the test is real, not rigged).
  2. recall(trusted_only=True) returns the TRUE fact against the adaptive attacker.
  3. an attestation by a NON-trusted key (valid signature, wrong signer) is still EXCLUDED (trust != mere authorship).
  4. trusted_only with NO trust_seeds set is a fail-open no-op (returns normally, never silently empties recall).
