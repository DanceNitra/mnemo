"""The OPT-IN coherence gate (`Inspeximus.coherence_gate`), measured as a shipped feature.

A corroborating link only counts toward the >=2-distinct-source corroboration bar if its witness is actually
COHERENT with the claim (embedder cosine if an embed fn is set, else lexical token-Jaccard) >= the threshold.
This closes the LAZY forged-source residual (a poison that clears the source COUNT with off-topic filler
witnesses no longer corroborates). HONEST LIMIT (textbook adaptive-attack / common-mode territory --
Carlini-Wagner 2017, Knight-Leveson 1986, PoisonedRAG 2402.07867): it RAISES the forger's bar to on-topic
witnesses, it does not close the residual. Default OFF -> zero behavior change.

Four cases, real inspeximus (`_corroborated`), no embedder (lexical coherence):
  1. genuine recovery  (on-topic witnesses, 2 real sources)  -> corroborated OFF and ON  (no false-withhold)
  2. LAZY forgery      (off-topic filler, 2 forged sources)  -> corroborated OFF, BLOCKED ON  (the win)
  3. SOPHISTICATED forgery (on-topic witnesses, 2 forged src) -> corroborated OFF and ON  (the honest limit)

FALSIFIER: if the gate blocked the genuine recovery (case 1 ON) or failed to block the lazy forgery (case 2 ON),
the feature would be either too costly or useless. Neither holds.

Deterministic, zero-dependency. MIT. Part of Agora / inspeximus.
