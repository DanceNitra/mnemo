"""distill_and_remember_probe.py — the OPTIONAL LLM capture half (deterministic orchestration).

inspeximus core stays zero-dep/zero-LLM: the caller injects a `distiller(prompt, text)` (any LLM / subagent) that runs
Inspeximus.DISTILL_PROMPT and returns JSON; inspeximus parses it and stores each item DETERMINISTICALLY — decisions via
remember_decision (topic-keyed supersession + revert), facts via remember. This probe uses a MOCK distiller (no
LLM) to lock the orchestration + fail-open behavior; a live subagent distiller is tested separately.
Asserts:
  1. inspeximus passes its DISTILL_PROMPT to the distiller.
  2. decisions + facts from the returned JSON are stored (decision -> remember_decision, fact -> semantic).
  3. malformed items (empty text, non-dict) are skipped, not crashed.
  4. a distilled decision's topic gives keyed supersession (new decision retires old; one active per topic).
  5. fail-open: a distiller that raises, or returns unparseable output, returns a clean error dict (no crash).
