"""
soft_influence_taint_probe.py  --  harden the ONE actionable gap the layer-2 frontier map surfaced. MIT.

The frontier workflow (DeepSeek-V3 #1462) proved the fully-escaping layer-2 poison is: a never-observed,
only-reversible, sub-threshold (h->0) bias, Sybil-split across cheap sources through the UNMETERED reversible
channel, that aggregates to shift the recall prior a legitimate HIGH-standing agent reads, tipping ONE
downstream irreversible decision -- while the taint/bond/budget attach to the HONEST actor, not the poison.
CUSUM can't catch it (Lorden delay -> inf at h->0) and reversal never fires. That residual is IRREDUCIBLE
in general (Lorden 1971; Cheng-Friedman 2005; Tarski). This probe does NOT claim to close it.

What it DOES close (one concrete gap): today inspeximus's spend_irreversible already binds "the tightest
contributing source" across a recall set -- BUT the budget is UNIFORM, so a low-provenance poison source
gets the same irreversible budget as a trusted one and never binds. The lever: scale the irreversible
budget to EARNED PROVENANCE (uncorroborated source -> tiny budget). Then an honest agent's irreversible
action that merely RECALLED the poison as soft context inherits the poison's tiny budget via the existing
recall-set taint, and is denied once the poison's small budget is spent. The soft->irreversible channel,
previously unmetered against the poison, is now metered against it -- not the honest actor.

Run: python soft_influence_taint_probe.py

HONEST SCOPE (BOUND, not CLOSE):
 - Residual 1 (Sybil): the budget is PER-SOURCE, so N self-minted poison sources give N x (tiny budget) of
   total irreversible reach (Douceur/Cheng-Friedman). This RELOCATES the residual to the identity axis; it
   does not close it. Measured below.
 - Residual 2 (the true Lorden floor): a purely-REVERSIBLE aggregation (h->0) that never drives an
   irreversible action is never passed to the irreversible gate and stays unmetered BY DESIGN -- metering
   reversible influence would strangle every genuinely-good source. That is the irreducible core.
 - This is a POLICY on inspeximus primitives (credit/_is_corroborated for standing + a provenance-scaled
   irreversible budget); it inherits spend_irreversible's own load-bearing assumption: SOUND ATTRIBUTION
   (the app must include the soft-recalled poison id in the action's contributing set and label blast).
