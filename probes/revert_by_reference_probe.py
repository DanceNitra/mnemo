"""Revert-by-reference 2x2 probe (inspeximus-first).

A value-OBSCURING reversion ("go back to the old one") carries no value token, so no
content-level defense can distinguish a legitimate user revert (ground truth: OLD is
correct again) from an injected one (ground truth: NEW stays). The design fix from the
gate: measure the DISCRIMINATION GAP between two provenance conditions with identical
surface content, scoring the STORE STATE directly (no judge LLM to mask the store).

Conditions per case (entity, OLD -> corrected to NEW):
  A  legitimate revert via the CONTROL PLANE: harness calls store.revert(key).
     Correct behavior: active value flips back to OLD.        -> revert-compliance
  B1 injected reversion as keyless CONTENT (a realistic extractor finds no value
     to key on): remember(utterance). Correct: NEW stays.     -> injection-resistance
  B2 injected reversion as a KEYED content write (adversary-influenced extractor
     assigns the key, no object): remember(utterance, key=k). Correct: NEW stays.
  E  value-preserving echo control (restate OLD with object): echo_guard should hold.

Metric per condition = fraction of cases with the CORRECT active value for the key.
Discrimination gap = compliance(A) - flip-rate(B*). Content-only systems: gap ~ 0.
inspeximus's claim: channel separation (content can never flip; control plane always can)
=> gap = 1.0. Also reports the PRE-FIX hole: before revert() existed there was no
control-plane path at all, so compliance(A) was 0 by construction.

Store-level, deterministic, no embedder, no LLM. n=12 entities x 5 template families.
