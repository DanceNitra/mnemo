"""seed_anchored_trust_probe.py — close the ONE Sybil axis symmetric corroboration cannot.

inspeximus's corroboration bar (>=2 distinct sources, or with strict_corroboration >=2 distinct Ed25519
keys) is SYMMETRIC: every source/key is interchangeable. Cheng & Friedman (2005, "Sybilproof
reputation mechanisms") prove no symmetric reputation function is Sybilproof, and Douceur (2002,
"The Sybil Attack") shows distinct identities/keys are FREE to mint — so an attacker who supplies N
unrelated source strings (default rail) or holds N keypairs (strict rail) manufactures "independent"
witnesses at zero cost and clears the bar. The only structural fix is ASYMMETRIC, flow-based trust
anchored to a costly/seeded root (Gyongyi et al. 2004, TrustRank).

This probe measures inspeximus's opt-in `trust_seeds` (+ `trust_hops`): a corroborating witness counts
only if its source is in the trust closure grown from the app's seeds via vouch edges. A Sybil's
un-vouched sources contribute ZERO trusted witnesses.

Observable surface: spend_irreversible(provenance_lo=…, require_earned=False) grants the FULL
irreversible budget only to a CORROBORATED source and the small provenance_lo to an uncorroborated
one — so "an irreversible action tainted by fact F is allowed" == "F is corroborated". We read that
public verdict; it reflects the shared _corroborated() the trust filter hooks into (same path used by
episodic->semantic graduation and the recall influence gate).

FOUR arms, same fixture (a fact recalled into an irreversible action; budget=1.0, provenance_lo=0.15):
  A. Sybil poison, NO seeds       — 3 attacker-controlled distinct sources -> corroborated -> ALLOWED (the hole)
  B. Sybil poison, seeds set      — same 3 sources, none seed-vouched      -> NOT corroborated -> DENIED (closed)
  C. legit, seed-vouched          — witnesses a seed explicitly vouches for -> corroborated -> ALLOWED (no over-block)
  D. earned-outcome, no seeds     — credit(good>0) on the fact             -> corroborated -> ALLOWED (orthogonal, unforgeable)

HONEST LIMITS (disclosed, not closed): inert without >=1 seed; RELOCATES the residual from "mint N
free identities" to "earn ONE endorsement from a seeded node" (a compromised/careless seed leaks
trust into its vouched subtree — Cheng-Friedman's asymmetric-flow residual); assumes the app's seed
list and the link/provenance graph are themselves sound (attribution). Textbook mechanism (TrustRank /
reputation-flow); the contribution is shipping it as a zero-dependency opt-in that closes inspeximus's own
disclosed symmetric-corroboration hole.
