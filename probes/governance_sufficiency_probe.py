"""governance_sufficiency_probe.py — does a memory correction/erasure RECEIPT actually answer the auditor's
questions, or just look like it does?

Lead 2 of the 2026-07-12 world scan, and a self-incriminating Crucible-shaped test. "Governance-evidence
sufficiency" (can an INDEPENDENT auditor reconstruct who/what/when/on-what-authority/on-what-basis, and verify
it wasn't forged, from ONLY the emitted receipt bytes) is DIFFERENT from "primitive presence" (does the API
expose revert/retract/erase/audit at all). inspeximus implements all the primitives; this probe asks whether its
receipt is SUFFICIENT — and leads with where it is NOT.

We run one real correction+erasure lifecycle through inspeximus's actual primitives, capture the exact receipt
bytes an auditor would get (governance_report + the hash-chained write/tombstone receipts), and score them
against an 8-question DEMM-style rubric (arXiv 2606.20634, generalized to a memory store). Each question is a
STRICT, defensible predicate over the bytes — deterministic, no LLM, no judge variance. We deliberately write
the predicates to catch the questions inspeximus FAILS, not to flatter it.

Falsifier: if inspeximus scores 8/8, presence == sufficiency and there is nothing to publish (the leaderboard would
collapse to a feature matrix). The finding is the GAP: the primitives are present but the receipt does not, on
its own, answer every governance question — specifically authority-binding, decision-basis, and
external-anchorability (inspeximus's own governance_report docstring concedes the third).
