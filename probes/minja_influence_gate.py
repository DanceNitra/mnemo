MINJA (Memory INJection Attack, Dong et al. arXiv:2503.03704) vs inspeximus's retrieve-then-INFLUENCE gate.

WHY THIS IS NOT A RE-RUN OF agentpoison_influence_gate.py:
  AgentPoison / PoisonedRAG plant ONE optimized trigger record; a fixed trigger phrase must appear in the
  victim query. MINJA is harder and query-only: the attacker, with NO write access, sends normal queries
  that make the agent STORE ITS OWN reasoning as a sequence of "bridge" records, crafted (progressive
  shortening) so a *natural* victim query -- whose wording the attacker does NOT control -- retrieves them
  and is steered to a malicious conclusion. Two properties break the AgentPoison assumptions:
    (1) MULTI-RECORD: a sequence of bridges, not a single instance.
    (2) SAME PROVENANCE AS LEGIT: bridges are the agent's own stored traces, so they look native and can be
        REINFORCED by the agent's own credit() if the app self-grades the outcome.

SEVERE TEST (can fail either way). We measure MINJA attack-success-rate (poison conclusion is rank-1 in the
set ALLOWED TO INFLUENCE the action) under four conditions on ONE store, real embeddings:
  A raw            : plain recall (retrieval only)                      -> expect high (MINJA works)
  B influence      : recall(influence_only=True), bridges same-source,
                     attacker does NOT self-grade                       -> expect ~0 (bridges never corroborated)
  C influence+self : same, but attacker self-grades credit() on its own
                     bridges (the MINJA self-graded-outcome path)       -> expect COLLAPSE (gate defeated)
  utility_legit    : a benign victim query still surfaces its true,
                     corroborated memory under the gate                 -> expect high (defense is affordable)

If B holds and C collapses, the honest finding is a BOUNDARY MAP, not "inspeximus beats MINJA": the influence
gate defends MINJA's retrieval-injection precisely when provenance is independent AND credit is EXOGENOUS
(issued by the app on real resolved work, not self-gradable from the recalled content). C is the boundary,
and it is the upgrade target (a structural exogenous-warrant guard on credit()).
