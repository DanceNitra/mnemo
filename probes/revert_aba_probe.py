"""revert_aba_probe.py — the ABA question (jacksonxly, r/RAG 2026-07-12): does submit_revert key on the
IDENTITY of what it retires, or on current content?

His case: a value is asserted, reverted, then re-asserted down a different write path so it reads identical.
A revert/restore that resolves on CONTENT can then land against the wrong assertion. If the intent carries
the id of what it supersedes, it is immune.

Measured on the real store, both in-stream paths:

  RELATIVE (revert_intent): base = current_active_id, target = the predecessor via superseded_by_toggle ==
    cur.id. Both ends are IDs. Under ABA (state moves to a same-value record) the base no longer matches ->
    conflict; it never lands against a re-asserted look-alike. IMMUNE.

  ABSOLUTE (restore_intent): 0.7.14 carried only a value token ("restore:key=VALUE#nonce") and resolved
    `VALUE in chain` -> content. 0.7.15 also carries the id of the specific record that held the value at
    mint ("restore:key=VALUE@ID#nonce") and requires THAT record to still exist with that value. A same-value
    re-assertion down another path is a different id and cannot satisfy it. The channel still owes the land
    (unconditional by design), but it lands a specific INSTANCE, not "the current value that looks like X".
