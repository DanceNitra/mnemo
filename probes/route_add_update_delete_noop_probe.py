"""route_add_update_delete_noop_probe.py — one-call route() now emits mem0-parity ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP.

route(text) is the single-call write router: it decides remember (ADD), keyed supersession (UPDATE), dedup
(NOOP — skip re-writing the current value), delete (DELETE — capability-gated so content can't destroy memory),
or revert. This makes inspeximus a deterministic, zero-LLM drop-in for mem0's add() reconcile UX. Asserts (each can FAIL):
  1. ADD: a new keyed fact -> event ADD, becomes the active value.
  2. UPDATE: a new value for the same key -> event UPDATE, supersedes (active = new).
  3. NOOP: re-routing the CURRENT value -> event NOOP and NO new record is written (dedup, not a duplicate).
  4. DELETE is capability-gated: with an authority set, an unauthorized "forget that" -> authorization_required
     (the content-can't-destroy-memory moat holds).
  5. DELETE with the right capability -> deleted, the key's active record is forgotten.
  6. revert still works (regression): "go back" restores the prior value.
