execution_receipt_gate_probe.py -- seal the "fabricated tool-call log" hole, don't just name it.  MIT.

The hole (raised on DeepSeek-V3 #1462 by @icophy for a "No Execution, No Memory" design): a memory is
allowed in only after a tool call -- but a session can WRITE a fabricated tool-call LOG ("I called
search('X') and it returned Y") that looks identical to a real one. The provenance-of-execution is
self-asserted content, so a fabricated execution earns memory exactly like a real one (the ~0.9 attack
success we measured for content-declared provenance across 10 models).

This is textbook signed-execution/attestation (code signing, RFC 9334 RATS remote attestation, SLSA
provenance) WIRED to memory-write standing -- the contribution is the wiring + a runnable receipt, not
the idea. It closes LAYER 1 only (provenance: a call HAPPENED), not LAYER 2 (veracity: whether a real
call's OUTPUT is honest). Signing authenticates the SOURCE, not the TRUTH.

The plug (this probe, runnable): bind a memory's EXECUTION STANDING to a RUNTIME-signed receipt, not the
session's word. LOAD-BEARING ASSUMPTION: the tool executor is a trust domain SEPARATE from the session --
an out-of-process runtime / MCP server / sandbox holding the Ed25519 key rt_sk unreadable by the session,
signing only results it actually produced. Given that, a real call produces a receipt signed over the
actual (tool, result); a memory claiming a tool result earns standing ONLY if attested by an ALLOWLISTED
executor key. A fabricated log has no runtime signature and cannot be forged into it (Ed25519). If the
executor shares a process/trust domain with the session, rt_sk is session-readable and the plug is THEATER.

Cost (the honest requirement): a small allowlist of trusted executor keys -- ONE key per tool-runtime,
an exogenous trust root. That is cheap (unlike per-fact attestation) and it is the thing that converts
"who wrote this" from a free string into a runtime signature.

Honest boundary (this RAISES/BOUNDS, it does not close poisoning): it seals FABRICATION (a log of a call
that never happened). It does NOT stop (a) a compromised runtime, (b) a session that holds the runtime
key, or (c) a REAL call that returns attacker-influenced data (a poisoned tool honestly signs a bad
result -- MINJA arXiv:2503.03704). That residual is bounded elsewhere (earned-outcome standing + a
reversibility checkpoint on the first irreversible use), not here.
