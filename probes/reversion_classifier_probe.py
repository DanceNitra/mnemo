"""reversion_classifier_probe.py — the Marat decomposition shipped as inspeximus.classify_reversion (0.7.14).

The joint TAT/inspeximus analysis factorized value-obscuring reversion detection into reference resolution (text)
plus recency attribution (ledger), with abstention on unresolvable references. classify_reversion() is that,
running on a real inspeximus store's own ledger. This probe measures it end to end on inspeximus-native data: per
entity we remember the old state with a descriptive record (it names the setter / a distinguishing feature),
then the correction, then classify four kinds of candidate:

  - REFERENCED REVERT  : describes the old state without naming its value ("go with what marcus decided")
                         -> should classify "revert", target = the superseded value.
  - AFFIRM CURRENT     : refers to the current state ("stick with the vendor's update")
                         -> should classify "keep".
  - BARE GO-BACK       : "let's go back", "undo that" — a value-obscuring revert that describes nothing
                         -> should ABSTAIN (unresolved_reference). This is the boundary: no content method
                            should decide it; the authorized-revert channel does.
  - UNRELATED          : an off-topic utterance -> should ABSTAIN.

Uses the local embedder (Ollama nomic-embed-text). The point measured: does the shipped classifier reproduce
the decomposition's behaviour — resolve real references correctly via the ledger, and abstain (not guess) on
the undecidable ones — on inspeximus's own store rather than on the paper's fixture.
