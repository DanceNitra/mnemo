"""retrieval_exposure_coverage_probe.py — does retrieval-exposure predict earned-outcome coverage?

Tests icophy's cross-framework hypothesis (DeepSeek-V3 #1462): "the fastest way to raise the earned-outcome
coverage of memory is to close retrieval loops — a memory that is retrieved and acted on generates a natural
outcome signal; unused memory stays dark." Measured on Agora's OWN live store (8 dungeon-agent inspeximus files).

FINDING (verified 2nd-way + per-store; the AUDIT is the point):
 1. STRUCTURAL, not correlational: 0 of the earned-outcome (good>0) records were NEVER retrieved — earned
    outcome is 100% downstream of retrieval, across all 8 stores. So the naive "retrieval predicts coverage"
    correlation is TAUTOLOGICAL here (credit() only ever fires on a recalled memory). Disclosed, not hidden.
 2. NON-TAUTOLOGICAL lever = the CONVERSION rate: retrieval is necessary but converts to an earned outcome
    only ~28% of the time (16-62% across agents). Exposure raises the ceiling; conversion is the bottleneck.
 3. Broader corroboration signal (has non-retrieval paths: >=2 links / graduation, so NOT tautological):
    exposed ~1.2x more corroborated (80-92% vs 71-73%), robust across all 8 stores. Real but modest.

Exposure proxy: last_access > ts + 1s (last_access is set ONLY at creation and in recall() -> a value above
creation-time means recalled at least once). Age confound noted: exposure concentrates in the oldest tertile.
