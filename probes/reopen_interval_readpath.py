"""READ-PATH REOPEN probe (marintkael's lead, r/RAG 2026-07-16) — run against the REAL mnemo store.

The confident wrong-merge is unattackable at WRITE time ("you cannot out-confidence your own confidence at the
moment you write"). The missing primitive lives on the READ path: mnemo.observe() — a POST-write review
trigger (the mirror of the Fellegi-Sunter clerical-review band, which holds a POSSIBLE match BEFORE the write).
When independent evidence CONTRADICTS a high-confidence settled record, corroborate it (>= reopen_corroboration
independent observations, so a single benign restatement of the old value does NOT reopen) and REOPEN the
interval for steward review, surfacing the prior value.

Measured here on real Mnemo (keyed supersession, no embedder needed — observe() matches on the object):
  (1) CONFIDENT WRONG-MERGE caught LATE, not never: a fuzzy match confidently superseded the true value with
      another entity's value. A baseline has no read path, so it never catches it. observe(true_value) x k
      reopens it once the contradiction corroborates.
  (2) VALUE-OBSCURING REVERT gets a key: observe(object=None) ('go back') reopens and surfaces the prior value.
  (3) FLOOD CONTROL (the honest falsifier): a single stray restatement of the old value (the OP's 'user repeats
      a preference they forgot they changed') must NOT reopen.
