"""spend_irreversible(require_earned=True) — closing the forgeable-corroboration path on the IRREVERSIBLE
tail, and pricing the coverage cost. (Follows the #1462 graph-shift finding: earned outcome is the one
signal a sybil cannot mint; a forged/attested >=2-witness sybil clears corroboration but not earned outcome.)

By default, spend_irreversible(provenance_lo=...) grants the FULL irreversible budget to any source that is
_corroborated — which in the default (non-strict) config accepts >=2 DISTINCT SOURCE STRINGS, a signal the
attacker sets (spoofable; see inspeximus/probes/poisoning_corroboration_gate.py). So a forged-source sybil poison
gets the full budget for an irreversible action. `require_earned=True` narrows the full-budget grant to
records with EARNED OUTCOME (good>0 and good>=bad, set by credit() on real downstream success), which a sybil
cannot fabricate. Cost: every not-yet-earned legitimate source is throttled to provenance_lo too.

This probe measures BOTH sides on the real shipped inspeximus (no mock), deterministic.
