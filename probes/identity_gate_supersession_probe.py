"""identity_gate_supersession_probe.py — does gating supersession on identity-resolution confidence prevent a
CONFIDENT-BUT-WRONG authoritative ledger? (marintkael's point, r/... thread 2026-07-15.)

Prior art, credited (NOT novel): Fellegi & Sunter, "A Theory for Record Linkage", JASA 1969 — the three-zone
rule (match / non-match / POSSIBLE MATCH -> clerical review); MDM match/merge stewardship (auto-merge above a
threshold, route the intermediate band to a steward queue, e.g. Informatica/Semarchy). The contribution here is
only the PORT into an agent-memory write path + the measured prevention vs an ungated baseline. In agent memory
nobody gates supersession on identity confidence: mem0/Zep-Graphiti/Letta all auto-commit an ungated update.

THE SCENARIO (deterministic, no LLM, no embedder). E entities each hold an authoritative value. A stream of
corrections arrives. The upstream identity resolver is NOISY: with prob p_miss it attaches a correction to the
WRONG entity, and it reports a confidence that is (imperfectly) lower when it is wrong. Two write policies:
  UNGATED  : supersede on whatever key the resolver returned (inspeximus default / mem0-style auto-commit)
  GATED    : remember(..., identity_confidence=c); c < fork_below forks a candidate instead of superseding
METRIC = authoritative-ledger CORRUPTION rate: fraction of entities whose authoritative value is now WRONG
(a correction landed on the wrong record). Lower is better. Also report the review-queue cost (candidates).
