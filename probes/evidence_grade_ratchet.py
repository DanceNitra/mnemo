"""The evidence-grade RATCHET (inspeximus 0.6.0): a claim's grade + novelty can only move UP on an EXTERNAL
event, never self-assigned. This probe shows (1) the ratchet holds (a generator can't upgrade its own
claim), (2) forge-cost (climbing costs distinct identities -- Douceur), and (3) replay: run our own 32
audited storefront claims through the ratchet and reproduce the audit's headline (0/32 'novel') for free.

Operationalizes the flagship "Labels failed more than measurements": novelty was a label the generator
self-assigned at write time; here it becomes a status a claim EARNS from an external empty prior-art
search -- so the over-labeling that audit found cannot happen in the first place.

Run: python inspeximus/probes/evidence_grade_ratchet.py    MIT. Part of Agora / inspeximus.
