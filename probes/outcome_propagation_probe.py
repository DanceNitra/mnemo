"""outcome_propagation_probe.py — does closing the retrieval loop (propagate_outcome) raise earned-outcome
coverage WITHOUT letting a non-driver poison earn credit?

Motivation (icophy #1462 cross-framework): retrieval->earned conversion is ~28% on our live store
(retrieval_exposure_coverage_probe.py) — an ATTRIBUTION gap (the app only hand-credits some acted-on
recalls), not a fundamental ceiling. propagate_outcome() auto-credits the decision-driving subset of the
last recall when the action is scored.

TWO measurements:
 A. CONVERSION (a MODEL, labeled as such): a stream of decision episodes; each recall has a driver; a
    fraction `scored` of actions get a gradable verdict. Baseline = the app manually credits with
    probability `manual`; propagation = auto-credit the driver whenever scored. Conversion = fraction of
    driver memories that end with good>0. This shows the lift is real GIVEN manual < scored, and that the
    true remaining ceiling is `scored` (the app-level scored-action rate), NOT the attribution step.
 B. POISON-EARN (the non-trivial, NOT-by-construction number): a poison sits in the recall set as soft
    context but is NEVER the honest driver. How often does it earn credit under each propagation mode?
      full-set (driving_only=False)      -> poison earns at its recall-set presence rate (forgeable)
      driving_only=True, ids=None        -> only corroborated recall members earn -> poison earns 0
      explicit driver (ids=[driver])     -> only the named driver earns -> poison earns 0
    Poison-safety of the explicit path = the safety of the recall that picked the driver (use
    influence_only for high-stakes so a hijack poison is never selected as driver).
