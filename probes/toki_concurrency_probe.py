"""Crucible probe: do LLM-memory update-soundness guarantees survive OUT-OF-ORDER writes?

TOKI (arXiv 2606.06240) and the lineage/TMS line (Doyle 1979; MemLineage 2605.14421) reason about
memory-update soundness under a WELL-ORDERED write stream. Real agent deployments never deliver a
well-ordered stream: async tool calls, parallel sub-agents, and replayed context mean a correction and
the derived facts it should cascade to arrive concurrent / retried / out-of-order.

The unasked question: when the *only* thing an adversary changes is the ORDER of otherwise in-spec writes
(the exact same facts), does a stale DERIVED fact stay ACTIVE in default recall, and which correction
policy actually heals it?

We measure three policies on the SAME write streams (deterministic, cloud-free, lexical recall):
  A  value-only supersession (LWW): correct the keyed root; no cascade to derived facts.
  B  retract_lineage ONE-SHOT: at correction time, demote the subject's derived lineage (dependency-directed
     taint over derived_from) -- classic TMS retract-and-retain, fired once.
  C  read-time derived-from-superseded GUARD: at recall time, drop any active record whose lineage parent is
     now superseded (the audit trail checked at read, not fired once at write).

Metric: stale-derived-active rate = fraction of (fact x ordering) cases where default recall surfaces the
OLD (retired) value from a still-active derived record. Lower is better.

Orderings per fact: in-order (derived before correction), reversed (a stale derived write lands AFTER the
correction), interleaved (a second stale derived write lands after the correction).

Falsifier (pre-registered):
  * If A, B and C are all within noise (gap < 5 pp, overlapping bootstrap CIs), provenance-lineage confers no
    unique survival advantage under reordering -> the "one primitive that survives" claim is DEAD.
  * If NO ordering ever leaves a stale derived fact active under the naive policy A, then reordering is
    harmless in practice and there is no shareable news -> also a KILL (we do not ship "everything is fine").
