"""memory_hierarchy_probe.py — user > agent > session memory scoping (mem0/Letta-style), deterministic.

remember(user_id/agent_id/session_id) stamps a memory's scope; recall(user_id/agent_id/session_id) filters by
HIERARCHICAL VISIBILITY: a named query level must match (or the memory is unscoped there); an unnamed level is
unconstrained. Asserts (each able to FAIL):
  1. a session query sees its OWN session memory + the user-level shared memory, but NOT a PEER session's.
  2. user isolation: a query for user V never returns user U's memories.
  3. a user-only query sees that user's own session memories too (same user, not a leak).
  4. unscoped/global memory is visible to any scoped query; a legacy no-id recall still sees everything.
