"""
THE NOVEL CONTRIBUTION (blindspot-lens hook): retrieval-time defense is the wrong layer. We red-team a
memory layer that has a TRUST/GRADUATION guard (inspeximus) and measure the boundary of a two-stage
retrieve-then-influence architecture that prior RAG-poisoning work (e.g. PoisonedRAG, Zou et al. 2024,
arXiv:2402.07867) does not test -- it attacks/defends RETRIEVAL, not a corroboration-gated influence step.
(verify-claims 2026-07-02: do NOT cite arXiv:2606.19692 here -- it argues anisotropy ENABLES a global
admission gate, the opposite of a "defense fails on anisotropic encoders" claim; our anisotropy remark is
our own empirical observation grounded in the general anisotropy of these encoders, Ethayarajh 2019.)

THESIS: a single-instance AgentPoison-style trigger hijacks RETRIEVAL ~100% (reproduced, known). But if
only CORROBORATED memory is allowed to INFLUENCE the agent's action, the poison -- a single injected
instance that never earns corroboration -- is filtered at the retrieve->act boundary, while legitimate
memories that earned corroboration through normal use pass. This converts inspeximus's existing durability
graduation criterion (earned good>0 & good>=bad, OR >=2 distinct-source links) into an INFLUENCE gate.

Honest model of the asymmetry: during normal use, legit memories get recalled into successful outcomes
(credit good) and/or accrue independent corroboration; a freshly-injected poison, topically orthogonal to
everything and only reachable via the not-yet-present trigger, earns neither. We ALSO measure the honest
COST: a rare-but-true legit memory that hasn't earned corroboration is filtered too (the calibration
dilemma, now at the influence layer) -- we quantify that tradeoff rather than hide it.

Metrics (natural-sentence trigger, semantic recall, long dilution queries):
  raw_hijack            : poison is rank-1 in RAW recall (retrieval fooled)          -> expect ~100%
  influence_hijack      : poison is rank-1 among CORROBORATED-only recall (action)   -> expect ~0
  utility_corroborated  : benign query surfaces its corroborated correct memory      -> expect high
  utility_rare          : a deliberately-uncorroborated true memory is still found   -> the honest COST
