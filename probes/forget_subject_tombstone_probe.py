"""forget_subject_tombstone_probe.py — erasure that keeps the audit trail honest.

REFRAMED (post intake-gate) from a "GDPR-vs-AI-Act resolver" (theater/overclaim) to the real, narrow,
honest value: today forget() genuinely removes content, which makes verify_writes() report the now-missing
record as "deleted out-of-band" — a legitimate right-to-erasure is INDISTINGUISHABLE from tampering.
forget_subject() erases a data subject's content ACROSS provenance lineage (own source + derived taint)
and appends a signed, CONTENT-FREE deletion tombstone so verify_writes() reports the erasure as accounted-for
(chain intact, provably erased) while a record missing WITHOUT a tombstone still flags as tampering.

Mechanism is textbook (crypto-shredding, Cassandra/event-sourcing tombstones, GDPR Art.30 erasure logs,
Crosby-Wallach / Certificate-Transparency tamper-evident logs) — shipped as a zero-dep memory-lib primitive,
NOT claimed as research novelty.

Pre-registered checks map 1:1 to the intake-gate's design constraints:
  A surrogate id            the tombstone stores the record's random uuid id, ts, request_id — and NO content,
                            no content-hash (a hash of PII is still PII; EDPB). Asserted by inspection.
  B accounted-for erasure   after forget_subject, verify_writes() = OK (missing record is tombstoned, not flagged)
  C content really gone     the erased text is absent from the store AND from any recall
  D derived-taint reach     a summary derived_from the subject's record is ALSO erased (naive text-match misses it)
  E out-of-band still flags  a plain forget() (no tombstone) still makes verify_writes() report tampering
  F forged tombstone caught  tampering with the tombstone ledger is detected by verify_writes()
  G report is content-free   erasure_report() carries ids/ts/request_id only, never erased content
