"""Probe: regex_extractor must not mint keys from non-referring subjects.

Found 2026-07-20 while ingesting a real conversational corpus (MemOps, arXiv 2607.12893) — NOT by any
synthetic probe, because every existing probe fed the extractor clean declarative statements.

On natural prose the copula patterns fire on pronouns, expletives and interrogatives:
  "It is important to ..."      -> key 'it'
  "There is a growing ..."      -> key 'there'
  "These are just a few ..."    -> key 'these'
  "What is the significance ..."-> key 'what'
Those keys then collide across completely unrelated sentences, and keyed supersession dutifully RETIRES
the earlier record. Measured on one 3.7k-sentence transcript before the guard: 103 supersessions, 83% of
them driven by such a key — e.g. a universal-basic-income sentence retired because a London-landmark
sentence shared the subject 'what'. That is silent data loss in a feature the README advertises for
free text.

The guard: a subject that IS, or ENDS IN, a non-referring word yields no key (the extractor's documented
fallback -> plain append). Legitimate keys must be untouched.
