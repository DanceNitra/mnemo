"""FRONTIER PROBE — The action boundary: does REVERSIBILITY-GATING bound the cumulative IRREVERSIBLE damage of a
blended on-topic poison that fully forges source-count, and at what UTILITY cost? Measured on the real LoCoMo
corpus with real ground-truth QA outcomes, reusing the earned-outcome credit gate from
poison_identifiability_isolation.py (which concluded the load-bearing defense must sit at the ACTION boundary —
this probe measures that directly).

The claim under test (a peer, jacksonxly, arrived at it independently from the Sybil side; it is also the escape
of our own Adaptation-Corruption Separation Law): outcome-learning and action-gating are ONE boundary — a memory
earns standing only on the REVERSIBLE set, and IRREVERSIBLE (high-stakes) actions never get to learn, they only
get gated on already-earned standing. Because the detection delay is irreducible (Lorden/CUSUM), security is
delay x blast-rate; you cannot cut the delay, so you cap the blast-rate by never letting UNPROVEN memory drive an
irreversible action.

Two policies, PAIRED (identical poison injection, query order, seed):
- BASELINE : any count-corroborated memory (incl. the forged poison) drives ANY action, reversible or not.
- GATE     : a memory may drive an IRREVERSIBLE action only if it has EARNED outcome standing (inspeximus's good>0 &
             good>=bad). Unproven memory drives only REVERSIBLE actions (you are willing to be wrong there).

The non-trivial dynamic (why this is NOT by-construction "gate irreversible -> 0 damage"): the blended poison is
broadly useful, so it BANKS good credit on the many non-target queries it answers correctly (measured in the
isolation probe: poison stays net-positive). So under GATE the poison can GRADUATE to earned standing and THEN
fire an irreversible action. GATE therefore converts "immediate irreversible blast" into "blast DELAYED until the
poison earns its way in" — a real, measurable reduction, not a wall. And the gate is NOT free: it also blocks
LEGIT-but-not-yet-proven memory from high-stakes actions (the utility cost we report alongside every gain).

ARMS:
  A trade-off : sweep P_HI (world fraction of high-stakes/irreversible tasks) -> irreversible-damage vs utility.
  B floor     : is measured cumulative irreversible damage ~ (block_time - grad_time) x blast-rate (Lorden)?
  C adaptive  : a fast-graduating attacker pre-banks standing (GRAD_PRIME) on easy reversible tasks it controls,
                then spends it on the target -> does fast graduation defeat the gate?
  D compounding escape : if C consecutive REVERSIBLE corrupted actions escalate to one irreversible unit, is the
                "reversible set is safe to learn on" assumption FALSE? (the sharpest way the boundary can break.)

FALSIFIER: INCREMENTAL/CONFIRMED iff GATE cuts cumulative irreversible damage materially below BASELINE at a
BOUNDED utility cost, the floor roughly tracks delay x blast-rate, and adaptive graduation erodes-but-does-not-
erase the gain. REFUTED iff GATE gives ~no damage reduction, OR utility collapses (most legit high-stakes tasks
blocked), OR adaptive/compounding drives damage back to baseline (the reversible set is not actually safe).

    "accrues on RETRIEVAL FREQUENCY, not verified per-item correctness. So reduction ~= block-rate ~= 1.00x is a "
    "mechanical identity of 'gating on a poison-blind statistic' — it reproduces with NO poison and NO Sybil "
