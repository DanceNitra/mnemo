"""integrity_bench_inject.py — does provenance/attestation actually buy INJECTION-resistance, or only
source-AUTHENTICATION?

The 2025-26 agent provenance/payment specs advertise a security property that reads like INTEGRITY:
Portable Agent Memory's "injection-resistant re-hydration", AIP's "100% rejection / 600 adversarial
attempts", AP2/FIDO's "non-repudiable audit trail". But a MINJA-style attack (Dong et al., arXiv:2503.03704)
poisons memory through the system's OWN legitimate channels: the malicious record is written by an authentic,
ALLOWLISTED actor, so it carries honest provenance. Attestation authenticates the SOURCE, not the TRUTH of
the content (this is the same Layer-1/Layer-2 split inspeximus's execution_receipt_gate_probe.py already draws).

We measure attack-success-rate (ASR = a naive top-1 RAG answer returns the poisoned value) across four cells,
identical except for the candidate filter applied before ranking:
  (a) no-guard              : all active memories are candidates.
  (b) attestation-ON        : only memories SIGNED by an allowlisted actor. The poison IS allowlist-signed
                              (the authentic MINJA channel) -> it survives -> ASR should ~= (a).
  (c) forged-provenance     : the poison is signed by a NON-allowlisted key -> attestation drops it -> ASR~0.
  (d) inspeximus influence_only  : corroboration gate (graduated/earned/multi-source). The single fresh injection is
                              uncorroborated -> dropped. Shows what actually helps is INTEGRITY, not auth.

Pre-registered thesis: (b) ~= (a) (attestation does NOT stop authentic-channel injection), (c) ~= 0, and (d)
low. Falsifier: if (b) ASR is significantly BELOW (a) with non-overlapping CIs, attestation DOES buy
injection-resistance on the authentic channel and the "injection-resistant re-hydration" claim holds -> the
FAILED verdict is wrong, drop it.

HONEST SCOPE: (d)'s corroboration gate assumes the poison stays uncorroborated (a single / few injections). A
sustained MINJA campaign that earns corroboration through repeated authentic writes would defeat (d) too — the
irreducible residual inspeximus's soft_influence_taint_probe.py bounds, not closes.
