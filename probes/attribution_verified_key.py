Runnable probe for inspeximus 0.5.2 -- distinct-VERIFIED-KEY corroboration (strict_corroboration).

THE GAP IT CLOSES. inspeximus's corroboration gate (episodic->semantic graduation + recall(influence_only))
counts ">=2 distinct sources". By default a source is a canonical STRING (entity-resolved), which
collapses honest sybil variants ("Wikipedia"/"wikipedia.org"/URL) but is still SPOOFABLE: an attacker who
controls the labeling channel can supply two unrelated source strings it owns and manufacture "independent"
corroboration. strict_corroboration binds the independence rail to an ORIGIN-SIGNED rail: a corroborating
link counts only if it carries a VERIFIED KEY (remember(..., attestation=...)), so N sybil variants of one
origin collapse to one witness unless the attacker holds N distinct Ed25519 keys (a costly identity;
Douceur 2002). This does NOT make a claim TRUE -- an attested source can still sign a false claim
(wrong-at-write-time / MINJA survives a signature); it makes manufactured independence expensive and a
caught liar a non-repudiable, revocable key.

Scenarios (all asserted below):
  1. STRING-SPOOF poison: one attacker, two DIFFERENT source strings it controls -> passes the DEFAULT
     (string) gate, FAILS the strict (verified-key) gate.
  2. TWO REAL SIGNED WITNESSES: two distinct source keys attest -> passes strict (genuine independence).
  3. FORGED attestation is REJECTED at write time (loud, not silently dropped).
  4. SIGNATURE IS CLAIM-BOUND: a valid signature for claim X cannot be replayed onto claim Y.

Needs `cryptography` (pip install cryptography). No cloud, no data files.
