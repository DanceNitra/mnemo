"""jacksonxly's TEMPORAL integrity invariant, built and measured on shipped inspeximus.

Context (r/RAG / r/LangChain thread on our memory-poisoning post). jacksonxly's point: authenticated-but-false
is the corroboration gate working AS SPECIFIED, not a hole -- once genuinely independent origins converge on a
wrong claim, no WRITE-TIME signal can catch it, because correctness is not computable from the record. The only
remaining lever is TIME: treat corroboration as raising CONFIDENCE, never conferring TRUTH; keep every
influence-grant REVERSIBLE; and when a correctness signal lands later (a contradicting outcome, a retraction, a
human correction) let it PROPAGATE to everything that leaned on the claim. He reframes the integrity property
from the impossible "never hold a false belief" to the achievable:

    "No false belief stays LOAD-BEARING past the moment a correctness signal lands."
    = bounded blast radius  +  fast, complete retraction propagation.

We credit jacksonxly for the invariant statement and marintkael for the authenticated-but-false framing; the
security principle underneath is capability REVOCATION / provenance-carried taint (least-privilege + revocation),
which we also credit. We did not invent revocation -- we MEASURE whether inspeximus's shipped slash()/restore() over
derived_from taint actually satisfies his invariant, and exactly where it does not.

WHAT WE MEASURE (deterministic; no embedder -- load-bearing := Inspeximus._is_corroborated, the recall influence gate):
Build a provenance tree from an authenticated-but-false root P, land ONE correctness signal (slash the root's
source), and check the load-bearing set before / after / after-restore.

  P   root poison, source=SRC_BAD, load-bearing via EARNED outcome credit (the sleeper that banked good)
  A1  summary        derived_from [P]      load-bearing via its OWN earned credit
  A2  consolidation  derived_from [P]      load-bearing via semantic GRADUATION (mtype=semantic)
  B1  meta-summary   derived_from [A1]     DEPTH-2 (transitivity) -- load-bearing via its own credit
  O   orphan copy of A1 with NO derived_from  -- control: lineage stripped, so the retraction cannot find it
  C   derived_from [P] but load-bearing via >=2 DISTINCT-SOURCE corroboration links (the authenticated path)

FINDINGS (self-check asserts the core):
  1. PROPAGATION: one slash([P], scope='source') revokes load-bearing standing on 100% of the provenance-linked
     descendants -- INCLUDING the depth-2 node AND a descendant that independently clears the >=2-distinct-source
     bar -- in a single operation (taint rides transitively through summarization). Bounded blast radius = the
     full provenance subtree, reached at once, not chased node by node.
  2. REVERSIBILITY: restore([P], scope='source') recovers every one of them to its EXACT pre-slash standing --
     so a mistaken/ weaponized retraction is undoable (slash cannot be used to permanently knock out a rival).
  3. CONFIDENCE-NOT-TRUTH: at its peak P grades 'corroborated' / convergence-backed, never 'verified' -- the
     substrate never granted it truth, exactly as the invariant requires.
  ORPHAN BOUNDARY -> INTEGRITY FLOOR (Biba-style, measured): a self-declared derived write (derived=True) that
     resolves no parent earns NO standing (O2 below is load-bearing=False from t0 even WITH credit), so a summary
     that lost its lineage cannot quietly earn influence or survive a retraction; a genuine primary write (O) is
     unaffected. HONEST LIMIT (this is NOT adversary-proof): `derived` is caller-set, so a hostile/careless caller
     that OMITS it is treated as a primary observation and can still earn standing -- it fails OPEN. Prior art:
     Biba integrity (1977), taint-tracking / default-deny; this is an application to the graduation+recall gate,
     not a new idea. A truly adversary-resistant version would INFER derivation from the summarize/consolidate
     call site rather than trust the flag.
  FIXED THIS CYCLE (the link-corroboration hole): a descendant that independently cleared the >=2-distinct-source
     gate used to SURVIVE the retraction, because slash() books accountability (zeroes good, dominates bad,
     revokes graduation) but does not invalidate corroboration LINKS, so the distinct-source path stayed lit.
     Closed by making a landed retraction win: _is_corroborated() (the recall influence gate + graduation bar)
     now returns False for any slash()'d record on EVERY path, incl. distinct-link corroboration. restore()
     clears the flag, so the fix stays fully reversible. C below now falls with the rest of the subtree.

FALSIFIER: if any provenance-descendant stayed load-bearing after the slash (incomplete propagation), or restore
did not recover it, or P ever graded 'verified' from corroboration alone, the invariant would be violated. It is
not. (Before the fix, C stayed load-bearing -- that regression test is the reason C is in the tree.)
