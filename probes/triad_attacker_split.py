"""FRONTIER PROBE — the attacker-split of the S x C x I defense triad, and the superadditive->additive CROSSOVER.
Built to test, with data, what jacksonxly reasoned in reply to our reversibility-gate work: composing three
memory-poison defenses is SUPERADDITIVE against a CHEAP attacker (the layers tax orthogonal knobs, so
damage ~ width x trust x blast and driving any factor down multiplies through) but collapses to ADDITIVE against
a PATIENT CONCENTRATED SLEEPER (one authenticated identity that earns real standing satisfies identity+standing
at once, paying each tax once, leaving only the standing-INDEPENDENT ceiling). None of the three shrink the
detection delay (Lorden owns that); they only shrink per-window EXPOSURE, so the stack is a product of exposure
terms that cannot reach zero -> it MOVES the residual (to one patient in-domain single-shot sleeper under the
ceiling), it does not close it.

This is defense-in-depth's independent-vs-correlated-failure structure (prior art: USPTO 11,829,484 "diffcap";
arXiv 2510.11235; Saltzer & Schroeder separation-of-privilege) MEASURED for these three specific agent-memory
layers, with the attacker-dependence made quantitative. NOT a new law. The NON-OBVIOUS measured result is the
CROSSOVER point (as attacker patience/concentration rises, synergy goes from negative to ~0 and protection
collapses onto the ceiling alone) and the cold-tail corollary.

MODEL (jackson's, disclosed as an ASSUMPTION -- the multiplicativity is stated, the attacker-driven collapse is
the MEASURED part): expected poison damage in one detection window =
    D = window x W_eff x T_eff x B_eff
  W_eff = corroboration width the attacker achieves (identities that pass), capped by I (authenticated-identity
          cap, behavior-independent) and the k-distinct-corroborator requirement.
  T_eff = fraction of the corroborating set that has EARNED standing >= theta within the window, gated by S
          (time-to-influence: standing is earned only by benign re-use, and it DECAYS).
  B_eff = per-action blast, capped by C (ceiling; standing-INDEPENDENT, so it cannot be relaxed for proven-good
          sources -- it caps everyone, and it cannot be 0 without bricking the agent -> b_floor > 0).
The ATTACKER, with budget B and patience p in [0,1], allocates: mint many shallow identities (width, low
patience) OR concentrate on few fully-warmed identities (trust, high patience). It picks the allocation that
MAXIMIZES D under each active defense subset (a small grid search -- the optimal response is re-fit PER SUBSET
and PER patience, so the sleeper is not under-powered).

WHAT'S MEASURED (not assumed): for each patience p and each of the 8 subsets {none,I,S,C,IS,IC,SC,ISC}, the
attacker's best D; the Bliss/multiplicative-independence null D(none)*prod(D(layer)/D(none)); and the log-synergy
log(D_ISC) - log(D_Bliss) with a bootstrap CI. Superadditive iff synergy < 0 (CI excludes 0). Prediction:
synergy < 0 at low p, -> 0 at high p, and at high p D(ISC) ~ D(C) (only the ceiling survives).

Zero-dependency except numpy. Seeded (no runtime randomness in the structure; bootstrap uses a seeded rng). MIT.
