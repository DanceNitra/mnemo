"""Auto-stamped lineage: the store carries the recall->write edge so a laundered summary can't escape a retraction.

Context. Our retraction probe (retraction_propagation.py) left one boundary open: an app-side LLM summarize step
that DROPS the derived_from link produces an "orphan" the retraction can't reach. jacksonxly's fix was to fail
closed on missing lineage; our own storm+verify pass (storm-reports/provenance-default-deny-agent-memory-briefing)
found the source-string form of that is textbook Biba (1977) and RELOCATES trust (a caller who must attach a
source can forge one; MINJA/AgentPoison carry valid provenance anyway). The ONE form with measured defense value
is AUTO-STAMPED LINEAGE PROPAGATION -- the store inherits the retrieved parents into the derived write, so the
lineage EDGE is carried by the store from the recall->write flow, not supplied by the untrusted LLM (MemLineage,
arXiv:2605.14421: signature-only 6/6 attacks -> 0/6 once ancestor lineage propagates, sub-ms overhead).

This probe MEASURES that mechanism on shipped inspeximus: recall() records what it surfaced; a subsequent
remember(..., derived=True) with no explicit parent auto-stamps derived_from from that recall, so the summary
carries its ancestors' taint and a slash on the root REACHES it -- the untrusted summarize step never had to
preserve the link. A derived write with NO preceding recall stays an orphan (fail-closed).

HONEST SCOPE (from the storm/verify pass -- do NOT overclaim): this closes the LAUNDERED/UNDECLARED-SUMMARY path
(lineage carried by the store, not the caller). It is Biba-style integrity, an APPLICATION of taint-tracking /
information-flow control, NOT a new idea, and it does NOT stop poison that carries valid provenance through the
legitimate channel (MINJA, arXiv:2503.03704) or that attacks retrieval geometry (AgentPoison, NeurIPS 2024) --
those need content-moderation + trust-decay retrieval, where provenance appears in no winning defense.

FALSIFIER: if the auto-stamped summary did NOT carry the root's taint (so a slash on the root missed it), or if a
derived write with no preceding recall were NOT an orphan, the mechanism would be doing nothing. Neither holds.

Deterministic, zero-dependency (lexical recall, no embedder). MIT. Part of Agora / inspeximus.
