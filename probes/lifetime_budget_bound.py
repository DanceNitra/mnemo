"""Severe test for inspeximus 0.4.9 `spend_irreversible` — the lifetime irreversible-influence budget.

The hole it closes (jacksonxly, r/RAG thread): monitor()'s CUSUM reference `k` is a tolerated RATE. An attacker
who holds its per-source bad-rate strictly below `k` drifts the statistic to 0 -> is PROVABLY undetectable -> nets
`k x exposure`. But exposure is PER-WINDOW, so over an unbounded horizon the total irreversible blast is
`k x infinity`. Capping a rate never bounds an integral. `spend_irreversible` caps the integral directly: a
per-source LIFETIME budget on irreversible influence, charged through the derived_from taint, refund-free.

This probe checks four claims, all as MEASURED numbers (no LLM; pure mechanism):
  (1) monitor() never catches the strictly-below-k attacker (S stays ~0, zero alarms) at ANY horizon.
  (2) WITHOUT a lifetime budget, the attacker's total irreversible blast grows linearly with the horizon
      (k x windows) -> unbounded.
  (3) WITH spend_irreversible(budget=B), that same undetectable attacker's total irreversible blast is capped
      at B regardless of horizon -> finite, chosen.
  (4) A good source keeps UNBOUNDED reversible influence (never metered) while only its irreversible tail is
      budgeted; and an action tainted (derived_from) by an exhausted source is DENIED (the tightest source binds).

Run: python lifetime_budget_bound.py
