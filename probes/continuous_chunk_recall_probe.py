continuous_chunk_recall_probe.py  --  recall(..., near=...): CONTINUOUS proximity retrieval. MIT.

inspeximus's `where=` / `prefer=` match CATEGORICAL metadata (theme == "identity"). But some memories carry a
CONTINUOUS state vector -- a TAT-style 5-D chunk (Theme, Role, Emotion, Meaning, Goal, each a float), or any
embedding-like feature stored in meta. For those you want NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR retrieval in the numeric
subspace, not exact match. `near=` adds exactly that, as the continuous analogue of `prefer`:

    recall(query, k, near={"target": {"theme": 0.29, "role": 0.33, ...}, "trust": 0.7, "half": 0.2})

For each candidate, distance = per-dim-normalised Euclidean over the target dims present as NUMBERS in the
record's meta; boost = 1 + trust*exp(-distance/half). Soft (never hard-deletes; missing dims -> neutral 1.0),
composes multiplicatively with text similarity and with `prefer`, and near=None is byte-identical legacy recall.

WHY it exists (measured on a real TAT 5-D state trace, DeepSeek-V3 #1466, @maratsultanov2): on a state/regime-
relevance task the field-state chunk carries the signal but the text is thin, and the values are CONTINUOUS so
a categorical filter can't touch them. Through inspeximus's own recall, near= on the state vector beats plain text:
    precision@5  0.984 (near)  vs  0.758 (plain text)   (+0.226)
    precision@10 0.972         vs  0.874                 (+0.098)
Honest scope: this is a soft continuous CUE, not a vector index -- it re-ranks the recall candidate pool, so
it shines when the pool is broad (thin/shared text) and the state vector is the real discriminator; it does
NOT add a temporal signal (a recency task still needs recency), and the win above is partly because that
particular text was uninformative. A dedicated vector store still beats it at pure ANN; near= is the
zero-dependency, composes-with-text option in the core.
