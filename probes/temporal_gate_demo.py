"""The OPT-IN temporal gate (`Inspeximus.temporal_gate`), measured as a shipped feature. Suggested by hannune (r/RAG).

A corroborating link proves independence of source, never independence of TIMING. Genuinely independent sources
rarely write within seconds of each other; a coordinated forgery writes its witnesses in a burst. `temporal_gate`
(opt-in, `m.temporal_gate = 60.0` seconds; default None -> zero behavior change) collapses CO-ARRIVING witnesses
(timestamps within the window of each other) to one anchor before the >=2-distinct-source count -- exactly as
_distinct_sources collapses one canonical source, but on TIME. So a 2-witness burst counts as one; two witnesses
spread out in time count as two.

Three cases, real inspeximus (`_corroborated`), timestamps set explicitly:
  1. genuine recovery, witnesses SPREAD OUT (hours apart, 2 sources)   -> corroborated OFF and ON  (untouched)
  2. BURST forgery, 2 witnesses co-arrive within the window            -> corroborated OFF, BLOCKED ON  (the win)
  3. PATIENT forgery, 2 witnesses spaced BEYOND the window             -> corroborated OFF and ON  (honest limit)

FALSIFIER: if the gate blocked the spread-out genuine recovery (case 1 ON) or failed to block the burst (case 2
ON), it would be useless or too costly. Neither holds. Case 3 is the honest limit: a patient attacker who spaces
writes out defeats a timing signal (patience buys past it -- the sleeper again).

Deterministic, zero-dependency. MIT. Part of Agora / inspeximus.
