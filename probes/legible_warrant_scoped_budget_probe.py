legible_warrant_scoped_budget_probe.py  --  make the not-asserting VISIBLE, and scope the floor. MIT.

Two small recall/gate additions, both from a live r/RAG thread with @jacksonxly (2026-07):

1. recall(..., with_warrant=True) -> each hit carries a LEGIBLE `warrant` tier a consumer can BRANCH ON:
     'earned'       -- un-self-gradable outcome credit (good>0>=bad) OR a graduated semantic memory
     'corroborated' -- >=2 distinct sources/verified-keys, not yet outcome-earned (weaker)
     'unwarranted'  -- single self-asserted, orphan (no lineage), or slashed
   WHY: a silent low score for "no independent channel" decays into "unverified but present" -- the next
   consumer reads quiet as a soft yes and you are back to consensus-over-poison with extra steps. The
   abstention has to be a first-class, visible STATE, not a number to infer.

2. spend_irreversible(..., provenance_lo=0.15) -> a source with NO corroborated contributing record is capped
   at the small provenance_lo instead of the full budget, so a LOW-PROVENANCE memory recalled into an
   irreversible action binds that action's budget against ITSELF (not the honest actor). This scopes the hard
   floor to the consequential slice -- what can actually cash out -- not the whole store (jackson's lever-1:
   "the tax base is smaller than the whole store"). HONEST: provenance_lo is a tunable knob, and it still
   relocates to the Sybil identity axis (fresh low-prov identity -> fresh provenance_lo); a policy default,
   not a closed defense.

Both are OPT-IN: with_warrant=False and provenance_lo=None reproduce byte-identical legacy behaviour.
