"""authorized_revert_probe.py — receipt for the authorized-revert channel (0.7.10).

Answers jacksonxly (r/RAG, 2026-07-11): the unmarked echo-vs-reaffirm case is an AUTHENTICATION problem, not
an NLP one. A stale echo and a deliberate reaffirm are byte-identical, so the tie-break cannot live in the
text; it must come from an authority whose ORIGIN an attacker who can only write text cannot author. This
probe demonstrates the fix and, per the owner, the RESIDUAL fix too (an on-box harness must not be able to
mint either — only an off-box private-key holder).

Threat model: the attacker controls the CONTENT stream (what text reaches route()). In the strong case the
attacker also controls the on-box process that holds the store (a compromised harness) but NOT the principal's
private key (held off the box).

Measured (all against the real shipped Inspeximus):
  A. NO authority (legacy): a poisoned "go back" routed with policy=trusting RESTORES the stale value -> the
     hole jacksonxly named is real and open by default.
  B. SYMMETRIC authority (revert_authority): the SAME poisoned text via route() cannot execute -> returns
     authorization_required, value unchanged. The principal path (revert with the minted capability) works.
  C. ASYMMETRIC authority (revert_pubkey; the residual fix): the store holds only the PUBLIC key. Neither the
     content path NOR the store/harness can mint an authorization; only sign_revert() with the OFF-BOX private
     key does. route() and an unsigned revert() both refuse; a principal signature succeeds.
  D. Forgery / replay / retarget battery (asymmetric): wrong key's signature, a signature for a DIFFERENT key,
     a REPLAYED signature after the state moved, an empty/garbage capability -> all refused. A store that only
     has the pubkey cannot produce a valid signature by construction.
  E. reaffirm=True direct write is gated too (can't bypass route/revert by calling the raw primitive).

Honest boundary asserted in output: this closes the content->restore path at the store, and in asymmetric mode
the on-box-harness->restore path too; it does NOT stop a stolen private key or authenticate a human.
