"""Probe: read-time conflict resolver (recall(resolve_conflicts=True)) — the un-keyed echo hole.

Write-time guards (keyed supersession, echo_guard) cannot reach an UN-KEYED re-assertion of a retired
value: it lands as an independent record and can out-rank the correction. This probe measures:
  1. the FAILURE EXISTS without the flag (un-keyed echo out-ranks the correction) — else the test is
     a demonstration, not a test;
  2. resolve_conflicts=True serves the correction, demotes the echo, and annotates `resolved_over`;
  3. value-birth semantics: a genuinely NEW value (honest update) still wins under the resolver;
  4. superseded-birth inheritance: after a KEYED correction, an un-keyed echo of the retired value is
     demoted (its birth = the retired row's birth);
  5. unrelated facts are untouched (no false clustering across subjects);
  6. determinism (two identical calls, identical order);
  7. the documented limit: a deliberate un-keyed reversal to an older value loses (use keys+reaffirm).
