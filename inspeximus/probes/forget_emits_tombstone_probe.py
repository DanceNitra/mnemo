"""forget() must leave a deletion receipt, or the store accuses itself of tampering.

Before 1.24.0 only forget_subject() and forget_pii() emitted tombstones. A record removed with plain
forget() therefore left a write receipt pointing at a row that no longer existed, with nothing
accounting for its absence — and verify_writes() reported exactly what it is designed to report in
that situation: "deleted out-of-band", the signature of someone editing the store behind its back.

Found by running the published wheel in a clean room and checking the claim "erasure with signed
receipts" against what the API actually does: the record was gone, the bytes were gone, and the
receipt count was zero.
