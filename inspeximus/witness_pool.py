"""Witness pool — the gossip layer that makes k-of-n anchor co-signing usable.

anchor()/verify_consistency() catch a rewrite on ONE timeline; a compromised store operator can still show
DIFFERENT histories to different clients (a split-view / fork). The 1.34.0 primitives (witness_cosign,
verify_cosigned_anchor, detect_split_view) close that IF independent witnesses co-sign the signed tree head.
This module turns those primitives into a runnable pool:

  - `Witness` — an INDEPENDENT party that co-signs a store's `anchor()` head AND remembers, per store, the last
    head it signed, so it REFUSES to co-sign a fork or rollback. That memory is what makes the guarantee real
    across time, so it is PERSISTED (json). A witness that has never been forked will simply never co-sign two
    inconsistent heads — which is exactly what a client's k-of-n check relies on.
  - `collect_cosignatures` — a client gathers co-signatures from a set of witnesses for one anchor; a witness
    that REFUSES (raises) is surfaced as a fork alarm rather than silently dropped.

No LLM, no GPU, no network dependency in the core logic (a witness can be local, in-process, or wrapped behind
HTTP by the caller). Zero new dependencies beyond `cryptography` (already the signed-store dependency).
