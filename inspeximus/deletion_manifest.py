"""deletion_manifest.py — a CROSS-STORE deletion manifest for right-to-erasure (GDPR Art.17) across the fan-out.

The gate (2026-07-13) killed the "tamper-evident single-store erasure receipt" framing: a DPO's real problem is
not a forged deletion record, it is that a subject's data has fanned out across the memory store, the app's
vector index, retrieval logs, caches, and backups — and a receipt for one store certifies one of many copies
(erasure_fanout_probe.py measured the app vector-index copy surviving 1.00 of the time after a store delete).

This manifest is the honest deliverable: register every place a subject's data can live as an ErasureTarget;
`execute()` erases each, then RE-CHECKS whether the subject's sensitive values are still recoverable there, and
records the per-target outcome in a hash-chained, optionally-signed manifest. It is honest BY CONSTRUCTION: it
reports residual recoverability rather than hiding it, and marks the overall erasure COMPLETE only if EVERY
registered target verified the data absent. It never claims to cover targets you did not register, nor
backups, nor embedding-inversion of retained vectors (Morris et al. EMNLP 2023) — those are stated as
out-of-scope, not silently passed.

This is a coordination/evidence primitive, NOT a proof of physical destruction: it attests, tamper-evidently,
which stores were acted on and whether the data remained recoverable at check time. Prior art: DSAR/erasure
orchestration (BigID/Transcend/OneTrust discovery), crypto-shredding, EDPB "verifiable and irreversible"
erasure, RFC 6962-style hash-chained evidence.

Zero external deps (stdlib only); Ed25519 signing optional if `cryptography` is present.
