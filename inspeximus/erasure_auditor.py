"""erasure_auditor.py — after you run a right-to-erasure deletion, does the data STAY deleted across the fan-out?

DSAR platforms (BigID, OneTrust, Transcend, DataGrail) orchestrate cross-system deletion and log that deletion
EXECUTED. The gap none of them close (confirmed by a compliance-engineer review, 2026-07-13): none re-attempts
ADVERSARIAL RECOVERY of the subject's data from the surviving stores — "deletion executed" is not "content no
longer reconstructible". A row can be gone while the embedding that encodes it survives in the index, a cache,
an offline snapshot, a retrieval log, or the chat history — and a retained embedding reconstructs the content
(Morris et al., "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text", EMNLP 2023; Ghost Vectors, arXiv 2606.18497,
recovers deleted clinical attributes from soft-deleted HNSW vectors).

This is a TOOL, not a research claim: register every place a subject's data can live as a StoreProbe; after your
app has run its deletion, `audit()` runs a per-store adversarial recovery attempt and reports where the data is
STILL RECOVERABLE. Honest by construction — it reports survivors, never a false "erased"; `erasure_verified` is
True only if NO registered store recovered anything. It cannot prove physical destruction, cannot cover stores
you did not register, and the vector-recovery check is a LOWER BOUND on the leak (full inversion is stronger).
Prior art credited above; the fix, when a store leaks, is hard-delete+reindex or crypto-shredding (destroy the
key, not the row — EDPB 05/2019; NIST SP 800-88 cryptographic erase).

Zero external deps for the framework; the VectorIndexProbe needs an embedder you pass in (e.g. local nomic).
