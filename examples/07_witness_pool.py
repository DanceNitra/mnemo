"""Witness pool -- k-of-n co-signing that makes a compromised memory host unable to show two different
histories to different clients. Runnable end-to-end.

A store's anchor() is a signed tree head committing to its whole write+erasure history. On its own it catches
a rewrite on ONE timeline (verify_consistency), but not a SPLIT-VIEW: an operator that shows client A one
history and client B another. Independent witnesses that co-sign the head close that -- an honest witness
refuses to co-sign a fork, so a client requiring k-of-n cannot be shown a forked head that reaches threshold.

Run: python examples/07_witness_pool.py
