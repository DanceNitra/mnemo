"""
inspeximus example 03 — semantic recall by bringing your own embedder.

    pip install agora-inspeximus
    python 03_semantic_recall.py

inspeximus has no required dependencies, so it ships no embedder. Pass ANY text->vector function as `embed=` and
recall becomes semantic (and, once the store grows, a lexical+semantic hybrid). Without one, recall falls back
to lexical — so this file runs either way.

To use a real model, `pip install sentence-transformers` and swap `my_embed` for the SentenceTransformer line
below.
