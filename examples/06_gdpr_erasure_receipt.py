inspeximus example 06 — the signed erasure receipt (GDPR Art. 17 / EU AI Act Art. 12).

    pip install agora-inspeximus
    python 06_gdpr_erasure_receipt.py

A data-subject-access/erasure request ("DSAR") arrives: erase everything you hold about a person.
Most agent memory stores can delete a row — but they cannot *prove* they did it. inspeximus emits a
signed, hash-chained, CONTENT-FREE tombstone per erased record, grouped by the request id, so you can
answer an auditor's "show me you erased X for request R at time T" without ever re-exposing the data.

That auditable trail is exactly what GDPR Art. 17 (right to erasure) and the EU AI Act Art. 12
(record-keeping / traceability, in force 2 Aug 2026) ask for, and what a plain vector-DB delete cannot
give you. No LLM, no embedder, no external service — one deterministic file.
