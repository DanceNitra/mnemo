"""Read-path review trigger (inspeximus 1.9.2-1.9.7) — the mirror of a write-time hold-for-review.

A store can be confidently WRONG: a correction lands, the record settles, and later a contradicting observation
arrives. You do not want to silently trust every contradiction (an attacker or a stray transcript line can
mint them), nor silently ignore it (a real correction never gets seen). observe() reopens a settled record for
STEWARD REVIEW — but only once the contradiction is CORROBORATED, so a lone restatement stays an echo. It never
supersedes; a human/steward closes the review with resolve_reopened().
