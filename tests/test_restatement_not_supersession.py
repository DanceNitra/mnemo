"""Agreement is not correction: a record restating the current value must not retire it.

Measured on the MemOps corpus (agora_output/lab/memops/keying_recall.py). Once the assistant's echoes
of a value are keyed - which is what a correction layer needs, since the first-person assertion is one
sentence in six - keyed last-write-wins turned every agreeing restatement into a supersession. Each key
kept exactly one active record however often the value was confirmed, and the current answer's
retrievability collapsed (present in a top-20 recall for 5 of 12 correction chains -> 3 of 12).

Two rules follow, both tested here:
  1. an identical value never supersedes (this file's first tests);
  2. a record that does not ASSERT A CHANGE never supersedes, even when its value string differs -
     "your address remains 742 Birchwood Lane, Unit 4A" and "Unit 4A" are one fact at two
     granularities, and only an extractor can see that the sentence claims no change. Extractors may
     therefore return a third element; a 2-tuple keeps the legacy behaviour exactly.
