"""Support-keyed read-path reopen (marintkael's fix, r/RAG 2026-07-16): key reopen on NOVELTY-OF-SUPPORT, not on
value. A restatement whose grounds the ledger has already seen (or that carries no support) is an ECHO and is
silenced even though it disagrees on value; only a contradiction resting on grounds NOT in the justification set
reopens, and corroboration counts DISTINCT novel supports. So replay collapses into echo by construction and the
value-disagreement DoS lever falls off, while an honest late correction bringing new ground still gets through."""
