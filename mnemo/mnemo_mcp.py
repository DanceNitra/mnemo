mnemo MCP server — expose Agora's memory layer to ANY MCP-compatible agent.

This wraps the zero-dependency `mnemo.Mnemo` store as a Model Context Protocol stdio server, so a
Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor / custom agent can use mnemo as its long-term memory: it can
`remember` facts, `recall` them value-ranked (relevance × accrued value, not just recency), run the
`consolidate` "dream" pass under a keep-budget, surface `contradictions`, and read value rollups.

mnemo.py stays dependency-free; only THIS file needs the MCP SDK:  pip install "mcp[cli]"

Run (stdio):
    MNEMO_PATH=./agent_memory.json python -m mnemo.mnemo_mcp
or register it in an MCP client (see mnemo/README.md for a .mcp.json / claude_desktop_config.json
snippet).

Config (environment):
    MNEMO_PATH        where to persist memory (JSON). Default: ./mnemo_memory.json
    MNEMO_EMBED_URL   optional OpenAI-compatible /embeddings endpoint for SEMANTIC recall
    MNEMO_EMBED_MODEL embedding model id (default: text-embedding-3-small)
    MNEMO_EMBED_KEY   bearer key for that endpoint
  With no embedder configured, mnemo uses its lexical-overlap fallback — it runs anywhere, today.

# Snippet truncation is OPT-IN (snippet_chars>0), NOT default: truncating a recall hit can cut off a corrected/
# current value that sits past the boundary, which would silently defeat mnemo's own supersession/echo-guard —
# so the default never truncates; opt in only when you accept that tradeoff and will get(id) for full text.
