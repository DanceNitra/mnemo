"""Is this exact server version already in the MCP registry?

    curl -s "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=inspeximus" -o reg.json
    python packages/_registry_state.py reg.json      # prints and writes already=true|false

Prints `already=true|false` and appends it to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`. The registry refuses a duplicate version
with a 400, which is correct on its side but made the publish step fail on any re-run, including a re-run
of a release that had already succeeded. Asking first turns "it is already listed" into the success it is,
without making the publish step swallow errors it should not.

The response is fetched by the caller with curl rather than here with `urllib`: urllib requests to this
host time out, both on a GitHub runner and locally, while curl and the Go publisher both succeed. Rather
than guess at their edge, the fetch uses the client that demonstrably works.
